<hr>

Brownian motion is the random trajectory described by particles suspended in a medium. <br>
That is, when we have some particle moving in such a way that it changes its direction in small random fluctuations, we say it is following a brownian motion. <br> <br>

This motion was first investigated by Brown when he described the rapid oscillatory motion of microscopic particles within the pollen grains of a flower when suspended under water as seen by a microscope. <br> <br>

The first explanation attributed the motion to thermal convection currents in the fluid. However, observations of two nearby particles describing very different Brownian motions refuted this theory. <br> <br>

Then, Einstein proposed that this motion was a consequence of the kinetic theory of gasses. According to this theory, particles in a fluid are constantly in motion, colliding and bouncing off between them. The explanation of Brownian motion was that the particles of the fluid also collided with the small pollen particle in random unpredictable ways, causing it to move in arbitrary directions. <br> <br>

The following animations represents a random walk, as that which a particle in brownian motion would describe.
