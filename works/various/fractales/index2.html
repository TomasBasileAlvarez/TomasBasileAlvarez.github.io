<hr>

<p> We continue our discussion of self similar fractals to consider now the construction of such fractals. </p>
<p> We saw before that a self similar fractal is a set \( E \subset R^2 \) such that there exists a set of similary transformations \( f_1, f_2, \cdots , f_n : R^2 \rightarrow R^2 \) with:</p>
<ol>
  <li> \( f_i(E) \subset E \;\;\;\; \forall i \)</li>
  <li> \( E = f_1(E) \cup f_2(E) \cup f_3(E) \cdots \cup f_n(E) \)</li>
</ol>
It is easy to see that actually, the first condition is a consequence of the second, but it is useful to include the first condition in order to better understand what the definition means. 
</p>

<p> In the previous discussion, we started with some fractals and then found the functions that acted as self similarities on them. </p>
<br>
<p> Now we will follow the opposite approach, suppose we are given a couple of similar transformations \( f_1, \cdots , f_n : R^2 \rightarrow R^2 \) and we want to find the corresponding fractal E such that it satisfies the two conditions of the definition (that is, such that the functions are self similarities of the set E and together they form the complete set E). </p>

<p> How do we find this fractal E given the functions?</p>

<p> For this, we first need a couple of definitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <strong> IFS (Iterated function system): </strong>  It is a set of functions \( \{f_1, \cdots , f_n\} \) with \( f_i : R^2 \rightarrow R^2 \) for all \( 1 \leq i \leq n \) such that they are also contractions, that is: 
  <center>
    $$ |f_i(x) - f_i(t)| \leq r_i |x-y| $$
  </center>
  For all \( x,y \in R^2 \) and \( 0 \leq r_i < 1 \). <br>
  This means, each function of the family must contract distances.
  </li>

  <li><strong> Hutchinson Operator: </strong>  Given an IFS, we define an operator \( H: C(R^2) \rightarrow C(R^2) \) (where \( C(R^2) \) denotes the set of all compact subsets of \( R^2 \) ) defined as: 
    <center>
      $$ H(S) = f_1(S) \cup f_2(S) \cup \cdots \cup f_n(S) $$
    </center>
    Where S is a compact set of \( R^2 \). The reason for asking the sets to be compact comes later.
  </li>
</ul>

<br> 
With this, we can redefine our problem. Given a family of similarity transformations, we wanted to find the fractal E defined by them (the set that satisfied the definition of a fractal with this family). <br>
Now, we rewrite the problem as: given an IFS (we are restricting the similarity transformations to be contractions, we will see why later) we want to find the set E such that \( H(E) = E \) <br>
We see that this is equivalent to the original problem because a set that satisfies \( H(E) := f_1(E) \cup \cdots \cup f_n(E) = E \) automatically satisfies the second condition to be a fractal, and therefore, also the first. <br>

<p> Given the Hutchinson operator, the set \( E\) that satisfies \( H(E) = E \) is called a fixed point of \( H \)</p>

<p> Therefore, our problem reduces to: Given an IFS, we want to find the set E that is a fixed point of H. This set will be the fractal with self similarities given by the functions \( f_i \)</p>

<br>
<p> To solve this problem, and find a method to obtain E,  we will need to use a well knwon theorem:</p>

<hr>

<strong> Fixed point theorem: </strong> If \( (X,d) \) is a complete metric space and we have a contraction \( T: X \rightarrow X \) (that is, it satisfies \( d(T(s), T(q)) \leq r d(s,q) \) for all \( s,q \in X \) and with \( 0 \leq r < 1 \) ). <br>
Then, there is a unique point \( e \in X \) that is a fixed point of T, that is \( T(e) = e \) <br>
Moreover, we can find this unique element by an iterative method, we begin with any element \( x_0 \in X \) and define the sequence \( x_n = T(x_{n-1}) \). <br>
Then, it can be proven that \( x_n \rightarrow e \).
<hr>

<br>
This powerful theorem is just what we need. We want to find a fixed set of the operator \( H: C(R^2) \rightarrow C(R^2) \). To use the theorem, we need to give \( C(R^2) \) a complete metric. <br>
Such a metric is well known and it is called the Hausdorff metric, defined as \( d(A,B)= inf\{\epsilon \; | \; A \subset B_{\epsilon} \; , \; B \subset A_{\epsilon}\} \) for  \( A, B \in C(R^2) \)<br>
Where we define \( A_{\epsilon} = \{x \in R^2 \; | \; |x-a| \leq \epsilon \;\; \forall \; a \in A\} \) <br>

<p> The details are not important, suffice it to say, this gives a well defined metric in \( C(R^2) \) and it can be proven that it is also a complete metric (the fact that we restricted ourselves to only compact subsets of \( R^2 \) is necessary to prove completeness)</p>

<p> Moreover, to use the theorem we would need \( H \) to be a contraction under this metric. This can be proven using the definition of H and  the hipothesis that the functions \( f_i \) are all contractions  (that is why we restricted the definition of IFS to include only contractions).</p>

<p> With these two facts, the theorem gives us a marvelous conclusion:</p>
<ul>
  <li> There is a unique subset \( E \subset R^2 \) such that \( H(E) = E\) (that is, the fractal we are looking for)</li>
  <li> We can reach this fractal by starting with any initial set \( X_0 \in C(R^2) \) and  iterating as follows: \( X_{n+1} = H(A_n) := \cup_{1 \leq i \leq n} f_i (A_n) \) <br> 
  And we will have that \( A_n \rightarrow E \) (convergence is defined in terms of the norm)</li>
</ul>

<p> This gives us a general method to find the fractal \( E \) given the functions we want as self similarities:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Given the functions \( f_1, \cdots, f_n \) we want as self similarities, define the Hutchinson operator as \( H(S) = f_1(S) \cup f_2(S)\cup \cdots \cup f_n(S) \)</li>
  <li> Start with any initial set \( X_0 \)</li>
  <li> Define \( X_{n+1} = H(X_n) \)</li>
  <li> Continue iterating using the function H until you get arbitrarily close to the unique fractal \( E\) having the defined similarities.</li>
</ol>



<h2> Examples </h2>

We can now try out this method to the fractals we saw in the previous discussion. <br>
<br>
<h4> Sierpinski Triangle</h4>

We remember that this fractal had the following similarity transformations:
<ol>
  <li> \( f_1 \):  Scale by 1/2</li>
  <li> \( f_2 \): Scale by 1/2 and translate in x direction by 1/2</li>
  <li> \( f_3 \): Scale by 1/2 and translate in x direction by 1/4 and in y direction by \( \sqrt{3}/4 \)</li>
</ol>

Now, if we want to find the fractal with these similarities (though we already know what we are going to get), we can define the Hutchinson operator as \( H(S) = f_1(S) \cup f_2(S) \cup f_3(S) \). <br>
And now, we can start with any set \( X_0 \) and iterate this operator many times to get closer and closer to the fractal. <br>
<br>

Use the following animation to do just that. <br>
First, draw any set \( X_0 \) using your mouse. Then, press Next to apply the operator \( H \) to your set once. See how each iteration of H consists on applying the 3 functions to every point on the page to get the next set of points. <br>
Note that the animation doesn't erase earlier sets on the iteration. That is, if you are on the fifth iteration \( X_5 \), the animation still draws \( X_4, X_3, X_2, X_1, X_0 \) even though they are not part of the set you are on. This is done so you can see how the set changes with iterations. <br>

<h4> Koch Curve</h4>

We remember that this fractal had the following similarity transformations:
<ol>
  <li> \( f_1 \):  Scale by 1/3 </li>
  <li> \( f_2 \): Scale by 1/3, rotate 60 degrees and translate in x direction by 1/3</li>
  <li> \( f_3 \): Scale by 1/3, rotate -60 degrees and translate in x direction by 1/2 and in y direction by \( \sqrt{3}/6 \)</li>
  <li> \( f_4 \): Scale by 1/3 and translate in x direction by 2/3</li>
</ol>

Now, if we want to find the fractal with these similarities, as before,  we can define the Hutchinson operator as \( H(S) = f_1(S) \cup f_2(S) \cup f_3(S) \cup f_4(S) \). <br>
And now, we can start with any set \( X_0 \) and iterate this operator many times to get closer and closer to the fractal. <br>
<br>

Use the following animation to do just that as with the Sierpinski triangle. <br>

<h4> Dragon Curve</h4>

We remember that this fractal had the following similarity transformations:
<ol>
  <li> \( f_1 \):  Scale by 1/2, rotate -60 degrees and translate in x directoin by 1. </li>
  <li> \( f_2 \): Scale by 1/2 and rotate 60 degrees.</li>

</ol>

Now, if we want to find the fractal with these similarities, as before,  we can define the Hutchinson operator as \( H(S) = f_1(S) \cup f_2(S) \). <br>
And now, we can start with any set \( X_0 \) and iterate this operator many times to get closer and closer to the fractal. <br>
<br>

Use the following animation to do just that as before. <br>
