<h2> Determinants in 2D</h2>

We all now the formula for a determinant of a 2x2 matrix, it goes something like this:
<center>
  \( \det \begin{pmatrix}
  a & b \\
  c & d
  \end{pmatrix} = ad - bc \)
</center>
<br>
<p>
But what is this number and why do we calculate it like this? </p> 
<p>
We usually think of determinants as some kind of function that takes in a 2x2 matrix and outputs a real number. But to undersand the meaning better, we will think of it as a function that takes two vectors of dimension 2 (in this case, the vectores \( (a,b) \) and \( (c,d) \), that is, the columns of the matrix ) and outputs a real number.  </p> 
<p> But given the two vectors, what does the determinant mean? </p> 
<p> That's simple, the determinant calculates the area enclosed by the parallelogram formed by the two vectors.  Before we go any farther, use the following interactive program.  </p>
<p> In the program you can control the coordinates of the first vector \((a,b) \) and of the second one \((c,d\). Then, you can see the parallelogram I mentioned, which is colored blue. The number we call determinant which comes from these two vectors is the area of the parallelogram. </p>

<p> So, that's what the determinant does. It takes two 2d vectors (that is, 4 numbers) and calculates the area enclosed between them (you may see the result is sometimes negative, we will talk more about this later).  </p>

<p> But why is the determinant calculated as \(ad-bc\)? For that, we refer to the following image:</p>

</center>


<p> The white figure is the parallelogram fored by the two vectors. The point blue dot has coordinates \( (a,b)\) and the red one \((c,d)\), while the black one is the sum of both vectros, so it has coordinates \((a+c,b+d)\). </p> 
<p> The area of the total rectangle is therefore \( (a+c)(b+d) \). The gray and black triangles and squares have their areas marked and it is easy to see that they are correct. Then, to get the area of the parallelogram, we take \( (a+c)(b+d) \) and substract the areas of the gray and balck figures. The result is   \( (a+c)(b+d) - 2ad - cd-ab = ad-bc\)</p> 

<p> So great, the expression \(ad-bc\) gives the area of the parallelogram, which explains the formula for the determinant. </p>

<h2> Notes</h2>

<ol>
  <li> <b>Sign:</b> As you can see from the program, the determinant is sometimes negative. This is because the determinant is not exactly the area of the parallelogram, we put a minus sign depending on the orientation of the vectors. If \( (a,b)\) is in the clockwise direction with respect to the \( (c,d) \), we put a minus sign to the result, otherwise, we leave the positive result. <br>
  This way, the determinant not only gives the area of the parallelogram but also the orientation.  </li>
  <li> <b> Higher dimensions:</b> In three dimensions, we take three 3d vectors as input to the determinant. The determinant is then the volume enclosed by these three vectors. For example, if we have three vectors \( r_1,  r_2 , r_3 \), we form the parallelepiped as shown and its volume will be the determinant of the matrix formed by putting those vectors as columns (with a positive or negative sign depending on orientation). </li>

  </center>
  It can be proven geometrically as before that the volume of this parallelepiped is given by the usual formula for 3d determinants, though now we have more terms and the expression is more complicated. <br> <br>

  <li> The determinant can be very useful to see if a set of vectors spans the whole space. For example, in two dimensions, if the vectors are colinear, they don't span the whole plane, and the are enclosed by them will be zero. In 3D, if the vectors are coplanar, they don't span the whole space, and the enclosed volue is zero. So we can see that the determinant will be zero when the vectors are not spanning the whole space. <br><br> </li>

  <li> We can generalize to higher dimensions just as we did for 3D, though now we would talk about hypervolumes.</li>
</ol>

<p> All this is a quite an informal treatment of determinants, but useful for an intuitive feel of them. However, determinants can be defined in a more algebraic way without any geometrical interpretation.   In this definition, the determinant is a function that takes the entries of a square volume and outputs a real number. In general, it is defined to be the only multilinear and alternating function with these characteristics. This definition lets us define the determinant in a better and more general way, but take away the intuitive feel for it. </p>
