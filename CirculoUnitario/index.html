<p> We are going to define trigonometric functions using the unit circle and use this to find intuitive ways to understand trigonometric identities. </p>


<p> First of all, we need to define cosine and sine ( we can later define the rest of the trigonometric equations).     </p>
<p> These functions take an angle as input and give as output a real number. </p>
<p> To define cosine and sine, it is best to use the following interactive program and later see the explanation.</p>

<p> After playing around with the application, it is easy to see the definition of these trigonometric functions </p>
<p> First, we take an angle 't' as input, this angle can be any real number (of course, the angle goes around the circle after 360 degrees). <br>
Then, we draw a dot in the unit circle with this angle 't' with respect to the horizontal (the black dot on the circle). <br>
As you can see, this dot moves around the circle depending on the angle chosen.
</p>

<p> Then, the definition of Sine and Cosine are very simple </p>
<ul>
  <li> Sin(t) : It is the vertical coordinate of the point in the unit circle with angle t.</li>
  <li> Cos(t) : It is the horizontal coordinate of the point in the unit circle with angel t. </li>
</ul>

<p> That's all. The definitions are that simple, and it is a good idea to have these definitions always in mind when using trigonometric functions. </p>

<p> Other trigonometric functions like Tangent  or Secant are actually defined using Cosine and Sine. So in my opinion, there is no need to really worry about them, as any expression involving other trigonometric functions can be converted into sines and cosines. <br> 
The other trigonometric functions also have a geometric interpretation equivalent to their functional definition in terms of sine and cosine, but as I said before, it is not necessary to go deeper into these definitions. 
</p>
Still, for completeness, here I presnet the geometrical defintion of other common trigonometric functions.

<p> This drawing is a little convoluted, and that is why I prefer to stick to only using sines and cosines (as I said earlier, any trigonometric expression can be reduced to these two functions using only definitions). </p>
<p> Also, it is an interesting excercise to see how these geometric defintions are equivalent to the common definitions for tan, sec, csc, cot. For example, try to prove using geometry that the blue line in the drawing denoting the cosecant really has a length equal to 1/sen(t) as it should by the common definition of csc. </p>

<h3> Intuitive Properties: </h3>

<p> Now, we can see how some trigonometric identities involving Sine and Cosine by using the geometric definition:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <strong> Range: </strong>  The range of the functions cos and sin are  between -1 and 1. <br>
  This can be seen directly from the definition, cosine and sine will always have a value between -1 and 1 because the point is inside the unit circle </li>
  <li> <strong> Some values of Trigonometric functions:</strong> For example, we can intuitively see that cos(0) = 1 and sin(0) = 0. Because when the angle is cero, the point on the circle is exactly in the coordinates (1,0). <br>
  We can similarly obtain values of cosine and sine at specific points using the unit circle. </li>
  <li> <strong> Pithagorean Identity: </strong> Seeing the drawing of the unit circle, it is clear that a rectangular triangle is formed with sides of length |cos(t)| , |sin(t)| , 1. So using the Pithagorean theorem, we see that \( \cos^2(t) + \sin^2(t) = 1 \)</li>
  <li> <strong> Shifts</strong>
  <ul>
    <li> We can see that cosine takes the same values as sine but with a shift of 90 degrees. Therefore, we conclude \( \sin(t + \pi /2) = \cos (t) \) </li>
    <li> Similarly, \( \cos(t + \pi /2) = - \sin(t) \)</li>
    <li> We can also see that if we add 180 degrees to the angle (that is take the point in the unit circle to the antipodal location), then the coordinates of the point will change sign, so  \( \sin(t + \pi)  = - \sin (t) \;\;\; , \;\;\; \cos(t + \pi) = - \cos (t) \) </li>
    <li> We can see that the functions have a period of 360 degrees, because turning 360 degrees doesn't change the point on the unit circle. Therefore \( \sin(t + 2\pi) = \sin(t) \) and \( \cos (t + 2\pi) = \cos (t) \) </li>
    <li> If we change the angle from t to -t, then the point on the unit circle will be reflected with respect to the x axis, so the y coordinate changes sign while the x coordinate stays the same. Therefore, \( \cos(-t) = \cos(t) \) and \( \sin(-t) = \sin(t) \)</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
